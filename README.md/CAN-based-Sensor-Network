This project involves a CAN-based sensor network designed for industrial monitoring. It utilizes STM32 and ESP32
microcontrollers to manage and transmit sensor data. Four sensors connected to the STM32 capture various
monitoring parameters, which are then transmitted to an ESP32 via the CAN protocol.The ESP32 receives this data
and uploads it to a cloud platform, allowing for real-time access and analysis from anywhere. This setup enhances
monitoring capabilities and ensures data accessibility and reliability in industrial environments
