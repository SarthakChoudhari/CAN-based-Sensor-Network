# CAN-Based Sensor Network for Industrial Monitoring
This project presents development of a secureÂ and efficient sensor network that combines Internet of Things (IoT) and Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. The network is designed to enable real-time data collecting and monitoring, with applications in security and environmental systems. Using IoT for smooth data transmission and CAN for robust, real-time communication, the suggested system intends to provide a dependable and secure solution for a variety of sensor-based applications. Temperature, gas, motion, and flame sensors are among the key components of the system, which are all integrated to STM32 and ESP32 microcontroller boards. The project also looks into the use of data visualisation technologies such as ThingSpeak to improve the system's ability to deliver real-time insights and monitoring. This integration of IoT and CAN protocol is intended to result in a highly reliable and secure sensor network, adaptable for both security and environmental monitoring purposes.
